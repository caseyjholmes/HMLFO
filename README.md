# HMLFO
Holmes Modular 2HP Eurorack Module Version of Niklas Rohnnberg's Analog LFO.. with PSI Power 

These are simple board files for a PCB and a panel for a small analog 2HP Eurorack format synthesizer LFO mModule with reversible power input. 
Just print yourself some PCB's up and add the parts then adjust the trimmer while you connect the outputs to an oscilloscope to calibrate. 
Note, if the pot isn't adjusted right, the circuit won't run properly. Don't be scared if it doesn't cycle intiailly. It needs calibration.

You may change C1 and C5 to adjust the LFO rates that are selectable via the switch. 
Enjoy!
