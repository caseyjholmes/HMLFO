# HMLFO
Holmes Modular 2HP Eurorack Module Version of Niklas Rohnnberg's Analog LFO.. with PSI Power 

These are simple board files for a PCB and a panel for a small analog 2HP Eurorack format synthesizer LFO Module with reversible power input. 
Just print yourself some PCB's and add the parts then adjust the trimmer while you connect the outputs to an oscilloscope to calibrate. 

Note: if the pot isn't adjusted right, the circuit won't run properly. Don't be scared if it doesn't cycle intiailly. It needs calibration.

Another note: use MTS-102 switches on ebay. You'll need to file down the tiny plastic nubs on the botton with a needle file to get the switches to fit at the same height as the jacks and pots, but it is very much possible. 

One more note and it's a big one. BE SURE TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE VALUES OF THE POTENTIOMETERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! 

You may change C1 and C5 to adjust the LFO rates that are selectable via the switch. 
Enjoy!
